# Hanzhi Yin's Personal Info Generator Pool

This directory is both a library and a script runner.
As a library, it contains type definitions and functions to describe and fetch personal data.
As a script runner, it generates related information and uploads to the corresponded AWS server. [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) is needed.

Do not consume any TypeScript objects directly in this project.
